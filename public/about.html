<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  
  Hi, this is Mustafa. I lived and worked in many states through my life. 
</p>
<p>
  I hold double major degrees in Information Systems and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I’m continously
  motivated by the chance to contribute to a collaborative team and continue growing in a
  dynamic environment.
</p>
<p>
  I have been involved in many industries (healthcare, technology, finance to count some) — allowing me to develop a versatile set of important qualities such as data analysis,
  process optimization, software development, QA, cross-functional collaboration, etc.
